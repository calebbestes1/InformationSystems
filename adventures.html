                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Last week I had my last day teaching at the MTC. And boy do I miss it already! I got to learn from these seven stellar missionaries for five short months. I learned a lot from each of them as they dedicated themselves to Christ every single day. It's not easy serving a mission. 
                            There are a lot of things you have to overcome that perhaps only Christ recognizes and understands. But there are also some miraculous changes that only Christ can make in you. As I worked with and shared testimony with the missionaries, it really helped me reflect on the lessons I learned (and am continuing to learn) on my own mission. Here are just a couple! I hope you aren't intimidated by their length haha..
                            <p>1) I learned to believe in more than the principles of the gospel. Believe in the application. What I mean by that is there were a lot of things that I firmly believed in before my mission. But on my mission I started developing the faith that these principles apply to me personally and right now. For example, I believed, generally, prayer had power for us. But I learned that prayer, personally, had power in my everyday life. It wasn't something that blesses everyone else but me. Heavenly Father knows me and I can have confidence in each principle and application of the gospel. 
                            </p>2) To see others deeply is a gift. And it's also a choice. There are so many people I see every day. They are lliving their own lives independent of me. However, they each have some deep hurt, concern, or trial in their life and I can make that just a little bit lighter. Likely, I won't change someones life in a day but I can help change their day. I truly believe that when we serve (or smile at or make time for or listen to) others, we directly serve Christ as well, for he experienced/felt everything they experience/feel. One of Christ's greatest attributes is compassion. And I learned how to have more compassion in my attitude towards others and in my thoughts. To look at others deeply and see their potential and to have, we must be connected to Him and work to follow promptings. 
                            <p>3) Faith = Effort. Not just effort in general, but effort to follow Christ. The more effort I give in (scripture study, bearing my testimony, or repenting), the more faith I am expressing in Christ. It takes sacrifice (whether of time, ego, or will) to do those things. And when we sacrifice, put forth effort, and express our faith, we access God's power. As I came to understand this simple things changed. I had better posture in my prayers and I dedicated time for it. I had a pen in hand to take notes while reading the scriptures. I was more observant of others needs and tried to offer help.  </p>
                            4) It's not about whether I think I can do it. It's about whether I'll do it for Christ. When I doubted miracles or my capacity to do something on my mission I noticed it was because I was only thinking about my capacity to accomplish it. But when I switched my mindset to whether God had the capacity to accomplish, I didn't have those doubts, even when it required great sacrifice from me. And there's no greater to sacrifice than to do it for Christ, who sacrificed everything for me. 
                            My mission taught me so much and I'm so grateful for the blessings I've had by serving a mission and to teach at the MTC. Thanks to everyone who was part of it in any way. Most importantly, thanks be to God.</p>
